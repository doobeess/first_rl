# First Roguelike

A roguelike based on Hexdecimal's 2024 [roguelike engine](https://github.com/HexDecimal/roguelikedev-tutorial-engine-2024). Moving steadily towards a complete game.

## Changes from engine
+ Added range-based randomness to attack strength.
+ Added a simple evasion system. (Target has [evasion] chance of dodging an attack.)
+ Added a simple enchantment system (+3, -2, etc.).
+ Weapons and armor no longer stack.
